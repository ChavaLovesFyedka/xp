## Description

XP: A skillshare platform for Flatiron students

## Screenshots

Add some spiffy screenshots of your app here.

## Background

Flatiron students are an eclectic and talented bunch. Our alumni and admitted students also are, doubly so. We wanted to create a platform to help connect those with things to teach to those with a desire to learn, and help promote the flow of knowlege with the Flatiron community.

We specifically hope to help admitted students find guidance as they progress through the pre-work.

## Features

* Front-end JavaScript to filter views based on various criteria.
* Use of "role" column in users and tags tables to enable efficient authorization and sorting.

## Usage

Users log on through github, and can immediately browse for available courses, request new courses, or volunteer to teach a course. Potential teachers can browse for requested courses and volunteer to teach them. Potential students can browse courses on offer and sign up to take them. Students may also request courses, and multiple students can sign on and show interest -- helping potential teachers identify and meet those needs.

## Development/Contribution

Scheduling features! Once students and teachers have been connected, how can we make help them find a time to meet?

## Future

A reputation/gamification system to help encourage continual participation once students graduate and become alumni. Drawing on github repos to calculate "expertise" based on the kinds of languages coded in.
